    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <main>
    <h3>Thanks for dropping by!</h3>
    <p>My name is Mike. I've lived in Seattle since 2006. I'm originally from Chicago. I am a musician with a background in performing, recording, writing, and teaching -- mostly from the perspective of guitar. I'm a writer, usually about music, and have work published in <em>The Fretboard Journal</em>, <em>American Standard Time</em>, and <em>KEXP Blog</em>. I've worked in many industries, including musical instruments, restaurants, and for the Seattle Public Library.</p>
    <p>I'd like to work somewhere in the space between dev and UX. My interests are more on the front end.</p>

    <p>I enjoy 35mm photography, studying Japanese, watching baseball (Seattle Mariners in the AL, Chicago Cubs in the NL, and Hanshin Tigers in NPB Central League), and travel. I spend most of my time with my wife Stephanie and cats, Blanco and Elwood. Blanco is entirely white, and Elwood is an orange tabby.</p>
