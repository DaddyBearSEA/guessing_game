    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h3>Thanks for dropping by!</h3>
    <p>My name is Mike. I've lived in Seattle since 2006. I'm originally from Chicago. I am a musician with a background in performing, recording, writing, and teaching -- mostly from the perspective of guitar. I'm a writer, usually about music, and have work published in <em>The Fretboard Journal</em>, <em>American Standard Time</em>, and <em>KEXP Blog</em>. I've worked in many industries, including musical instruments, restaurants, and for the Seattle Public Library.</p>

    <p>I have a BA in anthropology from University of Washington, and a certificate in professional technical writing, also from UW. I am currently studying software development at Code Fellows. I'd like to work somewhere in the space between dev and UX. My interests are more on the front end.</p>

    <p>I enjoy 35mm photography, studying Japanese, watching baseball (Mariners in the AL, Cubs in the NL, and Hanshin Tigers in NPB Central League), travel, and spending time with my wife Stephanie and cats, Blanco and Elwood. Blanco is entirely white, and Elwood is an orange tabby.</p>
